# BoostConverter

## Description

This project is under the MIT license, view it here [MIT license](license.md)
The solar charge board can only deliver 3V3 so we had to make a board that's convert the 3V3 to 5V. We need to do this because the SDS011 sensor has to work on 5V.

## Schematic of the boost converter

In this schematic you can see one big central component the MCP1640CT-I/MC. This component is a synchronous boost regulator with true output disconnect or input/output bypass option. This boost regulator is a DC-DC converter. There are also pins (SV1) provided to connect this board to the sensor board. On the schematic you can also see a coil we needed to put this in the schematic otherwise it was not possible to get the 3V3 to 5 V. There are also other components like resistors and capacitors.
